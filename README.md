### Project Proposal
This application will allow the user to revitalize their finances, whether it be for personal use, or for their business.
DontGoBroke is perfect for any consumer who can see the value in managing their income and expenses. This application can 
help consumer issues with money management, savings goals, finding forgotten subscriptions, and so much more. This application is specifically designed for those who want to be fiscally responsible. Because this application requires security authentication, it also makes the application user safe and guarantees privacy of your financial information.
